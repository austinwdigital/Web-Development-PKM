## 1. Key Concepts

- [x] Global Scope: Variables declared outside any function or block have global scope.
- [x] Function Scope: Variables declared within a function are only accessible within that function.
- [x] Block Scope: Introduced with `let` and `const`, variables are scoped to the nearest enclosing block.

> Summary: Scope in JavaScript determines the accessibility of variables, functions, and objects in some particular part of your code during runtime.

## 2. Detailed Notes

### 2.1. Introduction to Scope

- **Definition**: Scope is the current context of execution in which values and expressions are "visible" or can be referenced.
- **Why it's important**: Understanding scope is crucial for writing maintainable code, avoiding naming conflicts, and managing variable lifetime.
- **Use cases**: Proper use of scope helps in creating modular code, implementing data privacy, and optimizing memory usage.

### 2.2. Examples

```javascript
// Global scope
var globalVar = "I'm global";

function exampleFunction() {
  // Function scope
  var functionVar = "I'm function-scoped";
  console.log(globalVar); // Accessible
  console.log(functionVar); // Accessible

  if (true) {
    // Block scope
    let blockVar = "I'm block-scoped";
    const alsoBlockScoped = "Me too";
    console.log(blockVar); // Accessible
  }
  // console.log(blockVar); // ReferenceError: blockVar is not defined
}

exampleFunction();
console.log(globalVar); // Accessible
// console.log(functionVar); // ReferenceError: functionVar is not defined
```

Explanation of the example:

- `globalVar` is accessible everywhere.
- `functionVar` is only accessible within `exampleFunction`.
- `blockVar` and `alsoBlockScoped` are only accessible within the `if` block.

### 2.3. Challenges and Considerations

- Global scope pollution: Overuse of global variables can lead to naming conflicts and hard-to-debug code.
- Closures and scope: Understanding how closures capture their lexical scope is crucial for advanced JavaScript patterns.
- `var` vs `let`/`const`: `var` is function-scoped, while `let` and `const` are block-scoped, which can lead to different behavior.

## 4. Practice Problems

### Problem 1

- **Description**: Identify and fix the scope-related issues in the following code:

```javascript
function outer() {
  var x = 10;
  function inner() {
    var y = 5;
    console.log(x + y);
  }
  console.log(y);
}
outer();
```

- **Solution**:

```javascript
function outer() {
  var x = 10;
  function inner() {
    var y = 5;
    console.log(x + y); // This works fine, x is accessible in the inner function
  }
  inner(); // Call inner function
  // console.log(y); // Remove this line, y is not accessible here
}
outer();
```

### Problem 2

- **Description**: Create a function that demonstrates the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const` in terms of scope.
- **Solution**:

```javascript
function scopeDemo() {
  var functionScoped = "I'm function-scoped";
  let blockScoped = "I'm block-scoped";
  const alsoBlockScoped = "I'm also block-scoped";

  if (true) {
    var varInBlock = "I'm still function-scoped";
    let letInBlock = "I'm block-scoped";
    const constInBlock = "I'm also block-scoped";
    console.log(functionScoped, blockScoped, alsoBlockScoped); // All accessible
    console.log(varInBlock, letInBlock, constInBlock); // All accessible
  }

  console.log(functionScoped, blockScoped, alsoBlockScoped); // All accessible
  console.log(varInBlock); // Accessible
  // console.log(letInBlock, constInBlock); // ReferenceError: not defined
}

scopeDemo();
```

## 5. Questions & Further Study

- Question 1: How does the module pattern in JavaScript leverage scope to create private variables?
- Question 2: What are the implications of using `eval()` on scope?

> Additional Notes: Explore how scope works with arrow functions and the `this` keyword.

## 6. Reflection

- What did I learn from studying this topic? Scope is a fundamental concept that greatly influences how we structure and organize our JavaScript code.
- How confident do I feel about this topic now? Comfortable with the basics of scope, but need more practice with complex scenarios and how it interacts with other JavaScript features.
- What should I review next? Dive deeper into lexical scope and how it relates to closures and the module pattern.
