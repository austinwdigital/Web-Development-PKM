## 1. Key Concepts

- [x] Lexical Scope: The ability of a function scope to access variables from the parent scope.
- [x] Function Bundling: A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared.
- [x] Data Privacy: Closures can be used to create private variables and functions.

> Summary: Closures allow functions to retain access to variables from their outer (enclosing) lexical scope even after the outer function has returned.

## 2. Detailed Notes

### 2.1. Introduction to Closures

- **Definition**: A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment).
- **Why it's important**: Closures are a powerful feature in JavaScript that enable data privacy, function factories, and maintaining state in async operations.
- **Use cases**: Module patterns, callback functions, partial applications, and maintaining state in functional programming.

### 2.2. Examples

```javascript
function outerFunction(x) {
  let y = 10;
  function innerFunction() {
    console.log(x + y);
  }
  return innerFunction;
}

const closure = outerFunction(5);
closure(); // Outputs: 15
```

Explanation of the example:

- `innerFunction` forms a closure over the variables `x` and `y`.
- Even after `outerFunction` has finished executing, `closure` still has access to `x` and `y`.

### 2.3. Challenges and Considerations

- Memory leaks: Closures can lead to memory leaks if not managed properly.
- Overuse: Excessive use of closures can make code harder to understand and maintain.
- Performance: Closures have a slight performance overhead compared to regular functions.

## 4. Practice Problems

### Problem 1

- **Description**: Create a counter function that increments and returns a count each time it's called.

```javascript
function createCounter() {
  // Your code here
}

const counter = createCounter();
console.log(counter()); // Should output: 1
console.log(counter()); // Should output: 2
```

- **Solution**:

```javascript
function createCounter() {
  let count = 0;
  return function() {
    return ++count;
  };
}
```

### Problem 2

- **Description**: Implement a function that creates a "private" variable using closure.
- **Solution**:

```javascript
function createPrivateVariable(initialValue) {
  let value = initialValue;
  return {
    get: function() { return value; },
    set: function(newValue) { value = newValue; }
  };
}

const secret = createPrivateVariable(42);
console.log(secret.get()); // 42
secret.set(100);
console.log(secret.get()); // 100
```

## 6. Reflection

- What did I learn from studying this topic? Closures are a fundamental concept in JavaScript that enable powerful programming patterns.
- How confident do I feel about this topic now? Comfortable with basic usage, but need more practice with advanced applications.
- What should I review next? Explore how closures interact with other JavaScript concepts like prototypes and the `this` keyword.
