## 1. Key Concepts

- [x] Proxy: Acts as a programmable network proxy between web applications, the browser, and the network
- [x] Offline First: Enables offline functionality for web applications
- [x] Background Processing: Can handle tasks even when the web page is not open
- [x] Push Notifications: Enables web apps to receive push messages from a server
- [x] Lifecycle: Install, activate, and fetch events form the core of the service worker lifecycle

> Summary: Service Workers are a key technology for Progressive Web Apps, enabling offline functionality, background sync, and push notifications.

## 2. Detailed Notes

### 2.1. Introduction to Service Workers

- **Definition**: A service worker is a script that runs in the background, separate from a web page, enabling features that don't need a web page or user interaction.
- **Why they're important**: They enable key PWA features like offline functionality and push notifications.
- **Use cases**: Caching assets for offline use, intercepting network requests, background sync, push notifications.

### 2.2. Service Worker Lifecycle

1. **Registration**: The web app registers the service worker.
2. **Installation**: The browser installs the service worker.
3. **Activation**: The service worker activates and takes control of the client.
4. **Idle**: The worker idles until it's triggered by an event.
5. **Termination**: The browser may terminate an idle worker to conserve memory.

### 2.3. Examples

```javascript
// Registering a service worker
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js')
    .then(function(registration) {
      console.log('Service Worker registered with scope:', registration.scope);
    })
    .catch(function(error) {
      console.log('Service Worker registration failed:', error);
    });
}

// Service worker script (sw.js)
self.addEventListener('install', function(event) {
  event.waitUntil(
    caches.open('my-cache-v1').then(function(cache) {
      return cache.addAll([
        '/',
