## 1. Key Concepts

- [x] Responsive: Works on any device (desktop, mobile, tablet)
- [x] Connectivity Independent: Functions offline or with poor network
- [x] App-like Interface: Feels like a native app to the user
- [x] Fresh: Always up-to-date thanks to service workers
- [x] Safe: Served via HTTPS to prevent snooping
- [x] Discoverable: Identifiable as "applications" by search engines
- [x] Re-engageable: Can use push notifications
- [x] Installable: Can be added to home screen without an app store

## 2. Detailed Notes

### 2.1. Introduction to PWAs

- **Definition**: PWAs are web applications that use modern web capabilities to deliver an app-like experience to users.
- **Why they're important**: They bridge the gap between web and native apps, offering better performance and offline capabilities.
- **Use cases**: E-commerce sites, news platforms, social media apps, productivity tools.

### 2.2. Core Technologies

1. **Service Workers**: Enable offline functionality and background processing.
2. **Web App Manifest**: Provides metadata for the app, enabling "add to home screen" functionality.
3. **HTTPS**: Ensures the app is served over a secure connection.

### 2.3. Examples

```javascript
// Service Worker Registration
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  window.addEventListener('load', function() {
    navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js').then(function(registration) {
      console.log('ServiceWorker registration successful with scope: ', registration.scope);
    }, function(err) {
      console.log('ServiceWorker registration failed: ', err);
    });
  });
}

// Web App Manifest (manifest.json)
{
  "name": "My PWA",
  "short_name": "PWA",
  "start_url": "/index.html",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#ffffff",
  "theme_color": "#2196f3",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "icon-192x192.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2.4. Challenges and Considerations

- Browser Support: While improving, not all browsers fully support PWA features.
- iOS Limitations: Apple's support for PWAs is limited compared to Android.
- Discoverability: PWAs can be harder to discover compared to native apps in app stores.

## 4. Practice Problems

### Problem 1

- **Description**: Create a basic service worker that caches static assets.

```javascript

// Your service worker code here
```

- **Solution**:

```javascript
// sw.js
const CACHE_NAME = 'my-site-cache-v1';
const urlsToCache = [
  '/',
