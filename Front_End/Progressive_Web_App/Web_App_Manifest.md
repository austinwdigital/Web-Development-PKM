## 1. Key Concepts

- [x] Metadata: Provides information about the web application
- [x] Installability: Enables "Add to Home Screen" functionality
- [x] App-like Experience: Defines how the app should look and behave when launched
- [x] JSON Format: Written in JSON, making it easy to create and parse
- [x] Customization: Allows customization of app name, icons, colors, and more

> Summary: The Web App Manifest is a JSON file that provides information about a web application, enabling it to be installed on devices and behave more like native apps.

## 2. Detailed Notes

### 2.1. Introduction to Web App Manifest

- **Definition**: A JSON file that provides information about a web application in a single file.
- **Why it's important**: It's a key part of making a website installable and providing an app-like experience.
- **Use cases**: Enabling "Add to Home Screen", customizing the app's appearance, defining the app's entry point.

### 2.2. Key Properties

1. **name**: The full name of the application.
2. **short_name**: A short name for use in constrained spaces.
3. **start_url**: The URL that loads when the app is launched.
4. **display**: The preferred display mode (e.g., fullscreen, standalone).
5. **icons**: An array of image objects for app icons.
6. **background_color**: The background color of the splash screen.
7. **theme_color**: The theme color for the app.

### 2.3. Example

```json
{
  "name": "My Awesome PWA",
  "short_name": "MyPWA",
  "start_url": "/index.html",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#ffffff",
  "theme_color": "#2196f3",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "icon-192x192.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "icon-512x512.png",
      "sizes": "512x512",
      "type": "image/png"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2.4. Challenges and Considerations

- Browser Support: Not all browsers fully support all manifest properties.
- Icon Sizes: Providing multiple icon sizes for different devices and contexts.
- Testing: Ensuring the manifest is correctly interpreted across different platforms.

## 4. Practice Problems

### Problem 1

- **Description**: Create a web app manifest for a weather application named "WeatherNow".

```json
// manifest.json
// Your manifest code here
```

- **Solution**:

```json
{
  "name": "WeatherNow",
  "short_name": "Weather",
  "description": "Get real-time weather updates",
  "start_url": "/index.html",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#3498db",
  "theme_color": "#2980b9",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "icon-192x192.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "icon-512x512.png",
      "sizes": "512x512",
      "type": "image/png"
    }
  ],
  "prefer_related_applications": false
}
```

### Problem 2

- **Description**: Modify the manifest to include language-specific names and a scope property.
- **Solution**:

```json
{
  "name": "WeatherNow",
  "short_name": "Weather",
  "description": "Get real-time weather updates",
  "start_url": "/index.html",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#3498db",
  "theme_color": "#2980b9",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "icon-192x192.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "icon-512x512.png",
      "sizes": "512x512",
      "type": "image/png"
    }
  ],
  "prefer_related_applications": false,
  "scope": "/",
  "lang": "en-US",
  "dir": "ltr",
  "related_applications": [],
  "categories": ["weather", "utilities"],
  "screenshots": [
    {
      "src": "screenshot1.jpg",
      "sizes": "1280x720",
      "type": "image/jpeg"
    }
  ],
  "iarc_rating_id": "e84b072d-71b3-4d3e-86ae-31a8ce4e53b7",
  "orientation": "any",
  "name_i18n": {
    "es": "AhoraTiempo",
