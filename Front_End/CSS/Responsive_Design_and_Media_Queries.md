## 2. Detailed Notes

### 2.1. Media Query Syntax

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  /* CSS rules for screens up to 600px wide */
}
```

### 2.2. Common Breakpoints

- Mobile: up to 600px
- Tablet: 600px - 900px
- Desktop: 900px and above

### 2.3. Mobile-First Approach

Start with styles for mobile devices, then add complexity for larger screens:

```css
/* Base styles for mobile */
.container {
  width: 100%;
}

/* Tablet styles */
@media screen and (min-width: 600px) {
  .container {
    width: 80%;
  }
}

/* Desktop styles */
@media screen and (min-width: 900px) {
  .container {
    width: 60%;
    max-width: 1200px;
  }
}
```

### 2.4. Fluid Grids

Use percentage-based widths instead of fixed pixels:

```css
.column {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
}
```

### 2.5. Flexible Images

Ensure images scale with their container:

```css
img {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
```
