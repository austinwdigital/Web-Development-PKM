## 1. Key Concepts

- [ ] Interface Definition: A way to define a contract for an object's shape
- [ ] Optional Properties: Properties that may or may not be present in an object
- [ ] Readonly Properties: Properties that can't be changed after initialization
- [ ] Function Types: Interfaces can describe function signatures

> Summary: Interfaces in TypeScript provide a powerful way to define the structure of objects, ensuring type safety and improving code readability.

## 2. Detailed Notes

### 2.1. Introduction to Interfaces

- **Definition**: An interface is a TypeScript feature that defines the structure of an object, specifying the names and types of its properties and methods.
- **Why it's important**: Interfaces help catch errors at compile-time, improve code documentation, and enable better tooling support.
- **Use cases**: Defining object shapes, creating contracts for classes, and describing function types.

### 2.2. Examples

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  greet(): void;
}

function introducePerson(person: Person) {
  console.log(`Hello, I'm ${person.name} and I'm ${person.age} years old.`);
  person.greet();
}

const john: Person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  greet() {
    console.log("Nice to meet you!");
  }
};

introducePerson(john);
```

Explanation of the example:

- We define a `Person` interface with required properties and a method.
- The `introducePerson` function accepts any object that matches the `Person` interface.
- We create an object `john` that implements the `Person` interface.
- TypeScript ensures that `john` has all the required properties and methods.

### 2.3. Challenges and Considerations

- Interfaces are not available at runtime; they're a TypeScript-only feature.
- Balancing flexibility and strictness when designing interfaces.
- Understanding the difference between interfaces and type aliases.

## 4. Practice Problems

### Problem 1

- **Description**: Create an interface for a `Car` with properties for make, model, year, and an optional property for color. Then create a function that accepts a `Car` object and prints its details.

```typescript
// Your code here
```

- **Solution**:

```typescript
interface Car {
  make: string;
  model: string;
  year: number;
  color?: string;
}

function printCarDetails(car: Car): void {
  console.log(`${car.year} ${car.make} ${car.model}`);
  if (car.color) {
    console.log(`Color: ${car.color}`);
  }
}

const myCar: Car = { make: "Toyota", model: "Corolla", year: 2022 };
printCarDetails(myCar);
```

### Problem 2

- **Description**: Define an interface for a function that takes two numbers and returns their sum. Then implement a function that satisfies this interface.
- **Solution**:

```typescript
interface AddFunction {
  (a: number, b: number): number;
}

const add: AddFunction = (a, b) => a + b;

console.log(add(5, 3)); // Output: 8
```

## 5. Questions & Further Study

- Question 1: How do interfaces differ from classes in TypeScript?
- Question 2: When should I use an interface versus a type alias?

> Additional Notes: Explore advanced interface features like extending interfaces and interface merging.

## 6. Reflection

- What did I learn from studying this topic? (e.g., The power of interfaces in creating robust, type-safe code)
- How confident do I feel about this topic now? (e.g., Comfortable with basic usage, need more practice with advanced scenarios)
- What should I review next? (e.g., Classes, generics, or advanced interface techniques)
